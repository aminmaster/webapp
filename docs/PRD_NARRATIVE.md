# Product Requirements Document: The Narrative Journeys

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Approved

---

### **1.0 Introduction & Purpose**

This document serves as a high-level narrative guide to the core user experiences of the Equilibria Cognitive Concierge platform. It is a companion to the main, unabridged **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**.

The purpose of this narrative is to provide a clear and accessible overview of the "who" and the "why" behind our features, focusing on the emotional and functional journeys of our target users. It is intended for UX/UI designers, QA engineers, and stakeholders who need to understand the intended user experience without the density of the full technical specification.

Each section below provides a brief summary of a key user journey. For the complete, unabridged, and definitive specification of each journey—including detailed steps, edge cases, and success metrics—please refer to the linked section in the main PRD. **The PRD remains the single source of truth.**

### **2.0 Core User Journeys**

#### **2.1. The Anonymous Explorer: A Journey of Frictionless Onboarding**

This journey details the critical first-contact experience for a new, unauthenticated visitor. It covers their seamless transition from the landing page to their first interaction with the concierge, the system's ability to provide immediate value without requiring a signup, and the gentle, progressive nudge that invites them to create a permanent account only after they have experienced the platform's power. This flow is the cornerstone of our user acquisition strategy, designed to build trust and delight from the very first click.

#### **2.2. The Registered User: A Journey of Deep Engagement**

This journey outlines the powerful, feature-rich experience for an authenticated user. It begins with resuming a previous session and showcases the core productivity loop: asking a question, using the Knowledge Search modal to find and inject relevant context from the database into the conversation, and receiving a superior, RAG-powered response. It also covers the advanced "Power User" features, such as branching a conversation to explore a "what-if" scenario and using voice commands for hands-free interaction, culminating in the ability to export or share their findings.

#### **2.3. The Administrator: A Journey of Operational Control**

This journey details the workflow for a platform administrator. It covers accessing the secure admin dashboard, using the Knowledge Base tools to ingest new documents via file upload or URL, and monitoring the ingestion progress in real-time via Supabase channels. The flow continues with the administrator configuring and testing the AI models and API keys, and finally, using the analytics dashboards to monitor system health, user engagement, and the success rate of the RAG pipeline. This journey is designed to be efficient, transparent, and empowering for platform operators.

#### **2.4. The Resilience Journey: Error Recovery & Accessibility**

This journey is a cross-cutting narrative that details how the application behaves under adverse conditions and for all users. It covers the system's graceful handling of network errors with optimistic retries via TanStack Query, the function of the global Error Boundary in preventing application crashes, and the seamless queuing of offline actions via the PWA service worker. It also explicitly outlines the experience for a keyboard-only user navigating the Command Center and a screen-reader user interacting with the voice-enabled chat, ensuring our commitment to WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is a lived reality.
